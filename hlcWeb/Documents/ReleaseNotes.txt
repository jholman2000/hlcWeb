Hi Mark,

At long last I'm ready to get with you to get you started with the new site!  I've actually been doen with it since mid-August 
but things suddenly got very hectic.  Vicky ended up in the hospital for a few days unexpectedly (she's doing fine) and then
work got crazy right after that.  But things have settled down for at least a little while and I'd like to see if we can get
together sometime in the next week or two.

You're welcome to stop by my home, if that's a possibility, or I can come over to yours. My meeting nights are Friday evening
and Sunday at 5:00.  I get home from work and can meet anytime from 6:30pm onwards. We usually do our Family Study Wednesday or 
Thursday depending on what's going on that week so I'm flexible either evening.  Weekends are also possible.  It may take about 
1 1/2 to 2 hours to go over it with you.

I'd like to show you everything and see if there are any immediate changes that need to be made or if you wish to start testing
with it right away.  It is a completely redesigned website but runs concurrently with the existing site and both write to
the same database.

There's no rush from my end if the next two weeks are busy for you.  

Below is a highlight of some of the new stuff that is available.  I think you will be happy with it. As I said earlier it has
been a great learning tool for me to get used to some of the latest programming methods and I've already started benefiting from
it on my job.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Regards,
Jeff Holman
