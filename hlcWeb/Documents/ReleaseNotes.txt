Hi Mark,

Sorry it's taken me a while to get back to you but I now have the Presentations update in place on the site.  I've been testing 
it offline and finally got it moved up last night.  Below are the specifics of the things that have been changed/added.

I'd still like to get together with you to go over the site and discuss any changes or issues you have noticed when using it.
We never got around to doing that before.  Let me know if you would like to set something up.  My meetings are Friday nights 
and Sunday noon and I usually get home by 6:00 weekdays.

Go ahead and add a few pratice Presentations to see if you notice any issues and to see if I have the correct required fields
set.

Regards,
Jeff Holman

HLC SITE PRESENTATIONS RELEASE
==============================

Presentations
-------------
- You can now search and add Presentations to the site.  The data captured is based on the email you sent me in January.
- Currently only Admin-level users can add or edit a Presentation but all users can view it. (Let me know if you would
  like for all users to be able to Add/Edit)
- When adding/editing, you can click the blue "Select..." button to the right of the HLC Assigned, HLC Members present and
  PVG Elders present to expand an area with checkboxes listing the members/elders.  Checking or unchecking the names will 
  update the grayed out textbox with a list of names in alphabetic order
- Facility Type: Selecting Hospital will enable the "Select Hospital..." dropdown and selecting Practice/Legal/Other will 
  enable the "Select Practice/Facility..." dropdown.  (See Practice/Facility below)
- Department: There is a new table for Departments that have a few initial entries.  If you choose the "(Select this choice 
  if the correct...)" option it will enable the "New Department:" textbox to create a new department on the fly
- When you view the Presentation you can edit eh Goals, Planing Notes, etc.
- When viewing Presentation, clicking the Edit icon on the Planning box will take you to the edit screen with the Planning section
  expanded.  Clicking the Presentation Edit icon will open the edit window with the Planning section collapsed and
  the Presentation section expanded, but you can expand/collapse either section as needed and edit.
- When viewing the Presentation, you can click the Printer icon to open a new window with a printable version of the 
  Presentation.  It has a few blank lines for the areas that have not been filled in so thst you can print this and take it
  with you to the Presentation for making notes.  Keep in mind that printing from a web screen is browser dependent and
  page breaks are not easily controlled.  Let me know how this layout works for you and if you will need additional lines
  in the sections

Practice/Facility
-----------------
- The Practices table has been expanded to include capturing "Legal/Law firm" and "Other".  The first dropdown on the screen
  is where you indicate the type of entity being added.  Practice is the default.
- A free-form Notes field has been added for recording any notes or comments for the Practice/Facility
- When viewing the Practice/Facility, if it is a Practice then the list of "Doctors at the Practice" will appear.
- When viewing, the Notes section only appears when there have been Notes entered.

Administration
--------------
- When an Admin user is logged in, the dropdown menu under their name will show a new "Administration" option.  This option
  opens a page where you can edit the list of Specialties, Diagnoses or Departments
- You can Add New, Edit or Delete the three categories mentioned above.  This will help you to maintain these lists and
  correct missplellings that may have happened when adding on-the-fly.
- If you select to Delete one of the items, a confirmation screen will pop-up asking if you are sure.  This pop-up will
  alert you if this code is currently being referenced by a record in the system.  You can still Delete a code if it is
  in use but it will no longer display for the records that are currently pointing to it.

Delete
------
- A "Delete" button is now available when viewing a Presentation, Case File or PVG Member.  Clicking this button and confirming
  the Delete will physically delete the record from the database.

* INITIAL RELEASE
******************************************************************************************************************************

Hi Mark,

At long last I'm ready to get with you to get you started with the new site!  I've actually been doen with it since mid-August 
but things suddenly got very hectic.  Vicky ended up in the hospital for a few days unexpectedly (she's doing fine) and then
work got crazy right after that.  But things have settled down for at least a little while and I'd like to see if we can get
together sometime in the next week or two.

You're welcome to stop by my home, if that's a possibility, or I can come over to yours. My meeting nights are Friday evening
and Sunday at 5:00.  I get home from work and can meet anytime from 6:30pm onwards. We usually do our Family Study Wednesday or 
Thursday depending on what's going on that week so I'm flexible either evening.  Weekends are also possible.  It may take about 
1 1/2 to 2 hours to go over it with you.

I'd like to show you everything and see if there are any immediate changes that need to be made or if you wish to start testing
with it right away.  It is a completely redesigned website but runs concurrently with the existing site and both write to
the same database.

There's no rush from my end if the next two weeks are busy for you.  

Below is a highlight of some of the new stuff that is available.  I think you will be happy with it. As I said earlier it has
been a great learning tool for me to get used to some of the latest programming methods and I've already started benefiting from
it on my job.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Jeff Holman
