HLC Presentations
=================

1/6/19 Request from Mark:
Jeff 

Is it possible to add a Presentation section to the website? There would be 2 components to the information we need to gather.

The first component is the need to track efforts to schedule a presentation to a Hospital (specific department), Practice, Legal entities, etc:

•	Date
•	Facility or Group Name (we could pull from the list of Hospitals and Practices, but would need the option to type in a name not in the database)
>>>> I think that instead of allowing it here the user will have to create the Hospital/Practice/Facility first.    
•	Department (perhaps a drop down list similar to the way you’ve created the Diagnosis field in the Case section).
•	Contact Name (in most cases, this will not be a person in our database; however, there is a possibility that some Doctors from our database could be listed here)
>>>> Ok, I will keep this Contact data as part of the Presentation data even though there are fields for Office Contact on the Practice/Facility.  I may look into
>>>> the possibility of having a means of copying down the information from the Hospital/Practice/Facility record
•	Contact Title (free form text)
•	Contact Phone
•	Contact Email
•	Contact Address
•	HLC Member Name who is coordinating communication (free form or pull down from the login names)
>>>> This will be a dropdown of all HLC Members (users) for selecting ONE only
•	Goal for meeting/Issues to address (free form text)
•	Notes (free form text)
•	Referred by (free form text)
•	Is a CV required prior to presentation? (Yes/No)
•	Preliminary Date for the Presentation
•	Date for the Meeting to prepare for the Presentation
•	Names of HLC Members with the preliminary assignment. (free form or pull from the login names)


The second component includes data on the actual presentation:
•	Date of Presentation
•	Address
>>>>  Why is this repeated here?  If it ends up a different address can you indicate it in the Notes above?
•	Audience (perhaps a drop down list similar to the way you’ve created the Diagnosis field in the Case section. Here are some examples:  Administration, Ethics, Risk Management, Legal, Surgeons, Anesthesiologists, Nursing Staff, Pastoral Care, Patient Advocate)
>>>>  How does this differ from Department above?  Can this be just a free-form field since you have Department?
•	HLC Members attending (free form or pull from the login names) 
o	Name 1 (presenter taking the lead)
o	Name 2
o	Name 3
o	Name 4
•	PVG Elders present (free form text)
•	Presentation Topic (free form text)
•	Questions addressed (free form text)
•	Material given (free form text)
•	Follow up tasks (free form text)

It would be nice to have a report that could be printed and taken to the presentation enabling notes to be made on the form without having an iPad or computer at the meeting that could be distracting.

Let me know if this is possible (or a subset of the request).

Thank you!
Mark
