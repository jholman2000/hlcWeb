Hi Mark,

Searching and editing on Notes is a good idea and i will add that.  Editing I will limit to the System Admin and the 
individual who initially entered the Note.

I've looked at the Society's form you provided as well as your thoughts on an activity section and I think maybe it 
would work to add a new "Case File" table that would capture this information.  This would be entered separate from 
the Doctor's record but would have a field for Doctor and Hospital.  That way a Doctor could have multiple cases and 
you would also be able to change the case doctor to someone else if needed.  I've attached a proposed layout of what 
the table could look like.  I think it covers what you want to capture as well as provide the ability to generate 
data that could be used to fill the Society's form in the future.  I'm not sure that it has every detail the Society 
may ask but with the free form text fields I think you can cover most of the bases.

Take a look at the attached and let me know if you see any additional fields that you would like to capture on a 
case basis or any that I show that you do not need.

Regards,
Jeff
