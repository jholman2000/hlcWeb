Thanks, Jeff!  The spreadsheet is very helpful.

Would it be possible to add the capabilities to edit the “Notes" that have been entered? Would it be possible 
to Search on “Notes"?

It would also be helpful to add a section in the Doctor’s record for recent activity instead of using 
the “Notes” field for the JW cases he handles. Could each ‘activity section’ include the following fields 
to enter the date and free form text?

Date
Patient Name
Congregation
Medical Diagnosis
Relevant Medical History
Physician’s Treatment Plan
Possible Strategies
Medical Articles Shared
Contacted Consulting Physician
Patient Transferred
Outcome


I have attached a document from the Branch that I received Friday requesting specific information on 
Pediatric cases. We have not been collecting this information, so I’ll need to go through 3 years of 
emails to answer as many questions as possible. Let me know know if you think it is possible to 
add a “Pediatric” section within the Doctor’s record.

Thanks very much for everything you do to support us.

Regards
Mark
