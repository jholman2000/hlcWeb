Sure Mark. If you can send me a list of diagnoses I will set up an initial table. 

I do plan on having reports (finally) that can be filtered different ways and that will be one of them. I've 
already planned a simple search ability for cases, doctors, etc but the purpose of the search is really to aid 
in quickly finding a specific case/doctor, etc for viewing. The reports will handle the slicing and dicing. 

BTW, what browser and version do you use?  Do you know offhand what the other brothers are using?  Do you have 
an iPad or Android tablet?

Jeff,

Thank you for reviewing. I like the idea of a Case File table and thank you for preparing the layout. Yes, we 
should include a field for the age of the patient . It would be helpful if the field “MedicalDiagnosis” could 
be moved closer to the beginning of the record entry or make it a mandatory entry field. For consistency, could 
it be a drop down list of diagnosis types with the ability for each user to add to the list? We can start with 
a list of most common diagnosis and hopefully limit what is added by others.

Would it be possible to view all cases (listed by date entered, starting with most recent date) with the option 
to filter the view by Doctor, Entered by, Hospital, Pediatric Case, Diagnosis? 

Thank you!
Mark
